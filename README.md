# VitraHaus

## What is it ?
VitraHaus is a school project made at Les Gobelins in which we had to make an immersive experience to extends a piece of art, or to show some. 

## Inspiration
We choose to go with some generative art so we made an entire generated world inspired from Herzog and De Meuron's architecture.

## Technos
Three.js, P5.js & Stylus compiled with wepack, based on [this template](https://github.com/Lissandre/three_template).
We also used the Web Audio API, and Anime.js
